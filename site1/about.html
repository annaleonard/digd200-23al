                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Chloe’s Corner, a locally-owned ice cream shop in Philly that’s truly a labor of love. We set off in pursuit of our ice cream dreams in 1995, and we have been making sweet memories ever since. With fresh-made ice cream and Italian ice, we definitely have the best selection you’ll find, and we’ll always serve up your scoop with a smile. Nothing makes us happier than treating our wonderful community to refreshing pick-me-ups and a taste of the good old days. We are looking forward to many more years ahead.</p>
