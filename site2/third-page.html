            <h4>What Is a Community Cleanup?</h4>
            <p>A community cleanup brings volunteers together to clean, repair, and improve public spaces or other areas (such as vacant lots or abandoned properties) that have been neglected, vandalized, or misused. Cleanup projects can involve all kinds of public spaces—parks, riverbanks, schoolyards, sidewalks, playing fields, and even parking lots, to name just a few.<br></p>
            <p> </p>
            <h4>What Are Some of the Rewards of a Community Cleanup?</h4>
            <p>A community cleanup provides some of the most tangible rewards of any anticrime program. The results are immediately visible. People might even stop to thank you while you’re still working. Children may come out of their houses and wait eagerly to use the repaired playground equipment. And as your volunteers walk, skate, or drive by the site, each one will take pride in knowing that he or she helped regain an attractive, usable space for the neighborhood.<br></p>
            <h4>What is a Civic Association?</h4>
            <p>All across Philadelphia, neighbors join together to form community groups that improve their neighborhoods. Many civic associations are Registered Community Organizations (RCOs) with the City of Philadelphia, which means they are authorized to represent their neighborhood in zoning cases. Get involved with your local civic to hear neighborhood news, participate in community events, and weigh in on new development plans.<br></p>
